/// Undirected_graph
Node IDs can be arbitrary non-negative integers. Nodes and edges have no attributes/data associated with them.
There is at most one undirected edge between a pair of nodes.
Self loops (one per node) are allowed but multiple (parallel) edges are not.
The undirected graph data structure is implemented using sorted adjacency lists.
This means adding a node takes constant time, while adding an edge takes linear time (since adjacency list is kept sorted) in the node degree.
Accessing arbitrary node takes constant time and accessing any edge takes logarithmic time in the node degree.
///

/// TUNGraph::TNodeI::GetInNId
Range of NodeN: 0 <= NodeN < GetInDeg(). Since the graph is undirected
GetInNId(), GetOutNId() and GetNbrNId() all give the same output.
///

/// TUNGraph::TNodeI::GetOutNId
Range of NodeN: 0 <= NodeN < GetOutDeg(). Since the graph is undirected
GetInNId(), GetOutNId() and GetNbrNId() all give the same output.
///

///

/// TUNGraph::New
Call: PUNGraph Graph = TUNGraph::New(Nodes, Edges).
///

/// TUNGraph::AddNode (int NId = -1)
Return value is the ID of the node being added.
If NId=-1 node id will be automatically assigned (and returned).
If node of ID NId already exists, do nothing.
///

/// TUNGraph::AddNode-1 (const int& NId, const TIntV& NbrNIdV)
The operation can create inconsistent graphs unless the neighboring nodes (in NbrNIdV vector) exist.
Use TUNGraph::IsOk to check that the resulting graph is consistent after the operation.
Return value is the ID of the node being added.
If node NId already exists the function aborts.
///

/// TUNGraph::AddNode-2 (const int& NId, const TVecPool<TInt>& Pool, const int& NIdVId)
The operation can create inconsistent graphs unless the neighboring nodes (stored in the vector)
are also explicitly added to the graph.
Use TUNGraph::IsOk to check that the resulting graph is consistent.
Return value is the ID of the node being added.
If node NId already exists the function aborts.
///

/// TUNGraph::DelNode
If the node of ID NId does not exist the function aborts.
///

/// TUNGraph::AddEdge
If the edge already exists return -2. If the edge was successfully added return -1.
Normally the function should return an ID of the edge added but since edges in TUNGraph have no IDs we return -1.
The function aborts if SrcNId or DstNId are not nodes in the graph.
///

/// TUNGraph::DelEdge
If the edge (SrcNId, DstNId) does not exist in the graph function still completes.
But the function aborts if SrcNId or DstNId are not nodes in the graph.
///

/// TUNGraph::GetEI
Note that since this is an undirected graph GetEI(SrcNId, DstNId) has the same effect as GetEI(DstNId, SrcNId).
///

/// TUNGraph::Defrag
After performing many node and edge insertions and deletions to a graph,
the graph data structure will be fragmented in memory.
This function compacts down the graph data structure and frees unneeded memory.
///

/// TUNGraph::IsOk
For each node in the graph check that its neighbors are also nodes in the graph.

/// Directed_graph
Node IDs can be arbitrary non-negative integers. Nodes and edges have no
attributes/data associated with them.
There is at most one directed edge from one source node to a destination
node.
There can be an edge between the same pair of nodes in the opposite direction.
Self loops (one per node) are allowed
but multiple (parallel) edges are not.
The directed graph data structure is implemented using sorted adjacency
lists.
This means adding a node takes constant time, while adding an edge takes
linear time (since adjacency list is kept sorted) in the node degree.
Accessing arbitrary node takes constant time and accessing any edge takes
logarithmic time in the node degree.
