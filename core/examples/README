  SNAP : Stanford Network Analysis library
	http://snap.stanford.edu
========================================================================

Snap is a general purpose graph mining and modeling library. The library
is written in C++ and it scales to massive graphs with up to 200 million
nodes, and 2 billion edges.

Code compiles under Windows (Microsoft Visual Studio, CygWin with gcc) and
Linux and Mac (gcc). User the SnapExamples.vcproj or the provided Makefile.
Depending on your platform you may need to change Makefile a bit (see the
SnapSamples\Makefile).

Some of applications expect that GnuPlot and GraphViz are installed and
accessible -- paths are in the system PATH variable or they reside in the
working directory.

Depending on the platform (Windows or Linux) you may need to edit the 
Makefile of each individual example (edit examples/*/Makefile). 

Use 'make opt' to compile the optimized (fast) version of the code.

Example applications: http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/download.html

Execute:
  make all : compiles all sample applications
  make demo : executes all sample application
  
Examples:
  cascades :
  	Simulates an SI (susceptible-infected) model on various networks
  centrality :
        Node centrality measures (closeness, eigen, degree, betweenness, page rank)
  community :
        Network Community detection (Girvan-Newman and Clauset-Newman-Moore)
  concomp :
  	Manipulates connected components of a graph
  forestfire : 
  	Forest Fire graph generator
  krongen : 
  	Kronecker graph generator
  kronfit : 
  	Estimates Kronecker graph parameter matrix
  ncpplot : 
  	Computes Network Community Profile (NCP) plot 
  netevol :
  	Computes properties of an evolving network, like evolution of 
  	diameter, densification power law, degree distribution, etc.
  netstat :
  	Computes statistical properties of a static network, like degree
	distribution, hop plot, clustering coefficient, distribution of sizes
	of connected components, spectral properties of graph adjacency
	matrix, etc.
